Test website for pelican. This blog has a couple of files that depend
on the liquid_tags.notebook plugin. I haven't been able to make this
plugin work with newer versions of pelican. I'm using the pelican
3.3-1 in ubuntu. I think it also needs an older ipython (1.2.1).

I put the pelican-themes and pelican-plugins parallel to this blog and
use relative links in the pelicanconf.py.

I just brought up a new ubuntu 14.04 and it needs ipython-notebook and
pandoc installed too.
