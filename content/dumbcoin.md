Last year I wrote a
[toy bitcoin-like python implementation](bitpenny.md) for the Systems
and Network Security course. This year I found a much nicer toy
implementation called
[dumbcoin](https://github.com/julienr/ipynb_playground/blob/master/bitcoin/dumbcoin/dumbcoin.ipynb),
written by Julien Rebetez. His implementation is much cleaner than
mine, and includes several classes for transactions, wallets, and
blocks. He illustrates mining and validating transactions.
