I had a
[good skate session](http://www.mapmyrun.com/workout/823736965)
today. I took a lap around the Condado Lagoon. I'ts about 4.4 miles,
and took me some 38 minutes. It was partly cloudy and windy, but only
sprinkled on the course. The pavement wasn't too bad, and it was
mostly dry. The bike path parallel to Baldorioty Ave. is really nice.

It's been too long since I skated any distance. It's good to get some
exercise again.
