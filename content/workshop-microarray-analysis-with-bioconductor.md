I gave a workshop today on microarray analysis with
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org). The
[slides](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/teaching/microarray-workshop/expression-slides.html)
and a
[handout](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/teaching/microarray-workshop/expression-handout.pdf)
are online, and I have a
[github repository](https://github.com/humberto-ortiz/expression-workshop)
with the code for the slides, a handout, and the example scripts.
