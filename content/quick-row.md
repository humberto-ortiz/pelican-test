I went for a <a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/workout/455481697">quick row</a> on the Parque paseo lineal del Rio Bayam√≥n. I
hit a pretty good pace, it was overcast and cool. It sprinkled a
little when I started and when I finished, but the weather
cooperated. My shoulders are sore, I hadn't gone that fast in a long
time.
