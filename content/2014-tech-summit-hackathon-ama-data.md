I went to the [2014 Tech Summit](http://techsummitpr.com/) Hackathon,
but knew I had to leave early, so I did a solo hack.

One of the newly released data sets included some historical GPS data
from the
[Autoridad Metropolitana de Autobuses](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoridad_Metropolitana_de_Autobuses). I
decided to try to look at the bus service on Route 18, the one closest
to my home. It was bad in the 80's when I went to college, and in the
10's I'd heard complaints too.

So far, the data seems to indicate service has improved, although
there are hints of problems. I've put some
[ipython](http://ipython.org/) code up at
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/), check it out for yourselves,
you can
[see the notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/humberto-ortiz/ama/blob/master/parana.ipynb),
or [get the source code](https://github.com/humberto-ortiz/ama).
