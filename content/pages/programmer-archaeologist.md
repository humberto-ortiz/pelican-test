title: Programmer-Archaeologist

In [Vernor Vinge's](http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/) novel
[A Deepness in the Sky](http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/books/deepness_sky_000110.html),
Pham Nuwen, the main character, says he wants to become a
Programmer-Archaeologist, the most profitable profession in galactic
civilization. His mentor explains:

> Over thousands of years, the machine memories have
> been filled with programs that can help. But like Brent says, many of
> those programs are lies, all of them are buggy, and only the top-level
> ones are precisely appropriate for our needs.

The Programmer-Archaeologist searches for useful code in the
archives of software on the Internet and modifies it for current
needs.
