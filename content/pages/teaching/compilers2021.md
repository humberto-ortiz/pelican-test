### Alternative Teaching Methods

Certification No. 112 (2014-2015) of the Governing Board defines a
classroom course as a course in which 75% or more of the hours of
instruction require the physical presence of the students and the
teacher in the classroom.  This means that 25% of a classroom course
could be offered without requiring the physical presence of the
students and the teacher in the classroom.  If necessary, this course
will be able to complete up to 25% of the contact hours (11.25 hours)
on a non-face-to-face basis by alternative methods such as:
videoconferences, instructional modules, discussion forums and
others. If so, the calendar/agenda will be modified to include the
topics that will be covered by alternative methods.

## Instructional strategies

The professor will discuss each topic, students will complete a
practical excercise for each compiler technique discussed in
class.

## Instructional resources

The course will be hosted on the
[UPRRP Moodle](https://online.uprrp.edu/). Register and stay tuned for
our polls and forum postings.

## Textbook

The text for the course will be
[Ben Lerner's Compiler lecture notes](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs4410/).

Students with no functional programming experience will probably need
an additional text on OCaml.  I can suggest the free textbook by
Jason Hickey 
[Introduction to Objective Caml](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs134/cs134b/book.pdf).
Or the textbook by Michael R. Clarkson
[Functional Programming in OCaml](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2019fa/textbook/).

## Software

We will be writing our compiler in the functional programming language
[Objective Caml](https://ocaml.org/). See the website for instructions to download ocaml and opam.

## Evaluation

Students work will be evaluated on a 100% basis with the standard curve.

-        Participation in course forums (online, classroom), 25% final grade
-        Homework, 25% final grade
-        Quizzes, 25% final grade
-        Compiler project, 25% final grade


## REGULATION ON DISCRIMINATION BY SEX AND GENDER IN THE FORM OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE

The University of Puerto Rico prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual
orientation, and gender identity in any of its forms, including that of sexual
harassment. According to the Institutional Policy Against Sexual Harassment at
the University of Puerto Rico, Certification Num. 130, 2014-2015 from the Board
of Governors, any student subjected to acts constituting sexual harassment, must
tum to the Office of the Student Ombudsperson, the Office of the Dean of
Students, and/or the Coordinator of the Office of Compliance with Title IX for
an orientation and/or a formal complaint.

## REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION

The University of Puerto Rico complies with all state and federal laws and
regulations related to discrimination, including “The American Disabilities Act”
(ADA law) and Law #51 from the Puerto Rico Commonwealth (Estado Libre Asociado
de Puerto Rico). Every student has the right to request and receive reasonable
accommodation and Vocational Rehabilitation Services (VRS). Those students with
special needs that require some type of particular assistance or accommodation
shall explicitly communicate it directly to the professor. Students who are
receiving VRS services shall communicate it to the professor at the beginning of
the semester so that appropriate planning and the necessary equipment may be
requested according to the Disabilities Persons Affairs Office (Oficina de
Servicios a Estudiantes con Impedimentos –OSEI) from the Students’ Deanship
office. Any other student requiring assistance or special accommodation shall
also communicate directly with the professor. Reasonable accommodations requests
or services DO NOT exempt the student from complying and fulfilling academic and
course related requirements and responsibilities.

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

The University of Puerto Rico promotes the highest standards of academic and
scientific integrity. Article 6.2 of the UPR Students General Bylaws (Board of
Trustees Certification 13, 2009-2010) states that academic dishonesty includes,
but is not limited to: fraudulent actions; obtaining grades or academic degrees
by false or fraudulent simulations; copying the whole or part of the academic
work of another person; plagiarizing totally or partially the work of another
person; copying all or part of another person answers to the questions of an
oral or written exam by taking or getting someone else to take the exam on
his/her behalf; as well as enabling and facilitating another person to perform
the aforementioned behavior. Any of these behaviors will be subject to
disciplinary action in accordance with the disciplinary procedure laid down in
the UPR Students General Bylaws.

To ensure user data integrity and security, hybrid and distance education
courses are offered through the institutional learning management system, which
employs secure connection and authentication protocols. The system authenticates
the users’ identity with the username and password of their institutional
accounts. Users are responsible for keeping their password secure and not
sharing with others.
