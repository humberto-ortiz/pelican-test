## Description

Introduction to compiling, structure of simple one-step compilers:
syntax and lexical analysis, parsing, introduction to type checking,
intermediate code generation, introduction to code generation and
optimization. Discussion about tools for compilers design (e.g. Lex
and Yacc).

## Pre-requisite

   High Level Programming Languages (CCOM 4029)

## Content

- Introduction to compiling

- Simple one pass compilers

- Lexical analysis

- Symbol tables

- Parsing

- Syntax directed translation

- Introduction to type checking and run time environment

- Intermediate code generation

- Introduction to code generation and code optimization

- Discussion of tools in compiler design

## Objectives

1. Understand how the design of a compiler requieres most of the knowledge acquired during their study

1. Develop a firm and enlightened grasp of concepts learned earlier in
  their study like higher level programming, assemblers, automata
  theory, and formal languages, languages, languages specifications,
  data structure and algorithms, operating systems and computer architecture

1. Develop an inâ€“depth knowledge of major topics in compiler design.

1. Develop a fundamental understanding of various stages of compiling.

1. Apply the ideas, the techniques, and the knowledge acquired for the purpose of other software design

1. Develop fundamental knowledge of language specifications using context free grammars (CFG).

## Course Schedule

   Class will meet Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10:00 to 11:30 AM in NCL A-141. In
   UPR-RP attendance is compulsory.

## Instructional resources

The course will be hosted on the <a href="http://moodle.ccom.uprrp.edu/">CCOM Moodle</a>. Register and stay tuned
for our polls and forum postings.

## Textbook

The text for the course will be
<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/ml/">Modern Compiler Implementation in ML</a>
by Andrew Appel.

Students with no functional programming experience will probably need
an additional text on Standard ML.
I can suggest the free textbook by Andrew Harper of CMU
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/smlbook/">Introduction to Standard ML</a>,
or the books
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/MLbook/">ML for the Working Programmer</a> or
<a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/emlp.html">Elements of ML Programming</a>.

## Software

We will be writing our compiler in the functional programming language
<a href="http://sml-family.org/">Standard ML</a>. Several implementations are available, I recommend
<a href="http://www.smlnj.org/">Standard ML of New Jersey</a>.
Check your package manager, or download the newest version.

## Evaluation

Students work will be evaluated on a 100% basis with the standard curve.


 -        Participation in course forums (online, classroom), 5% final grade
 -        Homework, 25% final grade
 -        Two partial exams, 50% final grade
 -        Compiler project, 20% final grade


## Reasonable accomodations for students

Students with disabilities properly registered with the Office of
Affairs for Persons with Disabilities
<a href="http://estudiantes.uprrp.edu/impedimentos/impedimentos.php">Oficina de Asuntos para la Persona con Impedimento (O.A.P.I.)</a> should notify the professor at the
start of the semester. The professor will make reasonable
accommodations to support the student, in consultation with OAPI.
