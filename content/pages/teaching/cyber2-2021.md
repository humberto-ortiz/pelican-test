## Content

The course will use material developed for
[MIT's Graduate Computer Systems Security class](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2019/schedule.html)
under a
[Creative Commons Attribution license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/). The
original course material describes the content as:

> Lectures cover threat models, attacks that compromise security, and
> techniques for achieving security, based on recent research
> papers. Topics include operating system (OS) security, capabilities,
> information flow control, language security, network protocols,
> hardware security, and security in web applications. Assignments
> include labs that involve implementing and compromising a secure web
> server and web application, and a group final project.

## Objectives

After successfully completing the course students will be able to:

| Course Objective | Program Outcome |
|--------------|----------------|
| Analyze a computer system, identifying one or more potential security vulnerabilities |Creative and analytic ability, and capacity for logical reasoning |
| Exploit common security vulnerabilities | Ability to identify, organize, evaluate, and use information | 
| Understand mitigation techniques implemented in modern computer systems | Ability to identify and formulate problems in various real-life situations that can be solved by concepts and computational models and to implement them effectively|
| Implement changes to a computer system to mitigate security risks | Ability to identify and formulate problems in various real-life situations that can be solved by concepts and computational models and to implement them effectively |
| Assess the risks in a computer system | Creative and analytic ability, and capacity for logical reasoning |

## Course schedule

   Class will meet Mondays and Wednesdays from 10:00 to 11:20 AM. In
   [UPR-RP](http://www.uprrp.edu/) attendance is compulsory. This semester, due
   to COVID-19, we will be meeting online, not on campus. We will usually meet
   in Google Meet. The professor will provide the video link for each class to
   the student's official @upr.edu email address.

### Alternative Teaching Methods

Certification No. 112 (2014-2015) of the Governing Board defines a
classroom course as a course in which 75% or more of the hours of
instruction require the physical presence of the students and the
teacher in the classroom.  This means that 25% of a classroom course
could be offered without requiring the physical presence of the
students and the teacher in the classroom.  If necessary, this course
will be able to complete up to 25% of the contact hours (11.25 hours)
on a non-face-to-face basis by alternative methods such as:
videoconferences, instructional modules, discussion forums and
others. If so, the calendar/agenda will be modified to include the
topics that will be covered by alternative methods.

## Instructional resources

The course will be hosted on the [UPR RP Moodle](http://online.uprrp.edu/). 
Register and stay tuned for our polls and forum postings.

The course will use material developed for
[MIT's Graduate Computer Systems Security class](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2019/general.html)
which has lecture notes, videos, lab assignments and quizzes online,
as well as links to reference material.

## Textbook

We will mostly use the
[MIT course materials](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2019/schedule.html)

We will also use the
book. [Hacking: the Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition](http://www.nostarch.com/hacking2.htm). Jon
Erickson. No Starch Press. 2008. ISBN-13: 978-1-59327-144-2

## Software

MIT's [Lab 1](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2019/labs/lab1.html)
provides a
[virtual machine image](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jfrg/6.858-x86_64-v19.zip)
you will use for the lab assignments. I have tested the image on
VirtualBox (OS X and linux) and kvm (on linux). Other students have
had trouble with the `gdb` command on OS X. MIT recommends running in
VMWare player or kvm.

## Course policies

Be excellent to each other.

## Evaluation

Students work will be evaluated on a 100% basis with the standard curve.

 -        Participation in course forums (online, classroom), 25% final grade
 -        Homework and quizzes, 50% final grade
 -        Project, 25% final grade


## Reasonable accommodations for students

The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) complies with all federal and state laws and
regulations regarding discrimination, including the American with Disabilities
Act (ADA) and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Law 51. Students who have a
disability or condition that may impair their ability to complete assignments or
otherwise satisfy course criteria are encouraged to meet with the professor to
identify, discuss and document any feasible instructional modifications or
accommodations. The student should notify the instructor such disability or
condition as soon as such disability or condition is known to the student. The
student may also contact the Dean of Student Affair for information and
auxiliary aid.

Students with disabilities properly registered with the Office of
Affairs for Persons with Disabilities <a
href="http://estudiantes.uprrp.edu/servicios-al-estudiante/oapi/">Oficina
de Asuntos para la Persona con Impedimento (O.A.P.I.)</a> should
notify the professor at the start of the semester. The professor will
make reasonable accommodations to support the student, in consultation
with OAPI.

## Academic integrity

The University of Puerto Rico promotes the highest standards of academic and
scientific integrity. Article 6.2 of the UPR Students General Bylaws (Board of
Trustees Certification 13, 2009-2010) states that academic dishonesty includes,
but is not limited to: fraudulent actions; obtaining grades or academic degrees
by false or fraudulent simulations; copying the whole or part of the academic
work of another person; plagiarizing totally or partially the work of another
person; copying all or part of another person answers to the questions of an
oral or written exam by taking or getting someone else to take the exam on
his/her behalf; as well as enabling and facilitating another person to perform
the aforementioned. Any of these behaviors will be subject to disciplinary
action in accordance with the disciplinary procedure laid down in the UPR
Students General Bylaws.

## Discrimination

The University of Puerto Rico prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual
orientation, and gender identity in any of its forms, including that of sexual
harassment. According to the Institutional Policy Against Sexual Harassment at
the University of Puerto Rico, Certification Num. 130, 2014-2015 from the Board
of Governors, any student subjected to acts constituting sexual harassment, must
turn to the Office of the Student Ombudsperson, the Office of the Dean of
Students, and/or the Coordinator of the Office of Compliance with Title IX for
an orientation and/or a formal complaint.
