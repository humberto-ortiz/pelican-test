## Credits

3 credits

## Description

Introductory graduate course in bioinformatics to be offered Spring
2017 in UPR-RP. Topics covered will include biological sequences,
programming in python, UNIX, sequence alignments, sequence phylogeny,
sequence database searches, and gene expresion analysis, including
microarray and RNA-Seq analysis, and gene set or pathway analysis.

We will emphasize the fundamental theory behind the analysis, and also
present practical problems and their solutions. The course will use
open-source bioinformatics tools such as bioconductor, and show how to
construct such tools using python.

## Prerequisites

MATE 3026 or MATE 3028 or CCOM 3033

The course is designed for graduate and advanced undergraduate
students in biology or computer science. Students should have some
familiarity with programming.

## Course schedule

The course will meet Monday and Wednesdays from 1:00-2:20PM in room
CNL A-141, Natural Sciences, Rio Piedras Campus, University of Puerto
Rico.

## Objectives

Introduce students to fundamental concepts in bioinformatics,
programming, algorithm design and analysis. After completing the course,
students should be able to select tools and programs to solve
bioinformatic problems and participate in their development.

## Instructional strategies

The professor will discuss each topic, students will complete a
practical excercise for each bioinformatic technique discussed in
class.

## Evaluation

Students work will be evaluated on a 100% basis with the standard curve.

-        Participation in course forums (online, classroom), 25% final grade
-        Homework, 25% final grade
-        Two partial exams, 50% final grade


## Reasonable accomodations for students

Students with disabilities properly registered with the Office of
Affairs for Persons with Disabilities
[Oficina de Asuntos para la Persona con Impedimento (O.A.P.I.)](http://estudiantes.uprrp.edu/impedimentos/impedimentos.php)
should notify the professor at the start of the semester. The
professor will make reasonable accommodations to support the student,
in consultation with OAPI.

## Academic integrity

>    The University of Puerto Rico promotes the highest standards of
>    academic and scientific integrity. Article 6.2 of the UPR Student
>    Bylaws (Certification JS 13 2009–2010) states that “academic
>    dishonesty includes but is not limited to: fraudulent actions,
>    obtaining grades or academic degrees using false or fraudulent
>    simulations, copying totally or partially academic work from
>    another person, plagiarizing totally or partially the work of
>    another person, copying totally or partially responses from
>    another person to examination questions, making another person to
>    take any test, oral or written examination on his/hers behalf, as
>    well as assisting or facilitating any person to incur in the
>    aforementioned conduct”. Fraudulent conduct refers to “behavior
>    with the intent to defraud, including but not limited to,
>    malicious alteration or falsification of grades, records,
>    identification cards or other official documents of the UPR or
>    any other institution.” Any of these actions shall be subject to
>    disciplinary sanctions in accordance with the disciplinary
>    procedure, as stated in the existing UPR Student Bylaws.
