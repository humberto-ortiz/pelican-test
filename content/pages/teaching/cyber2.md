## Description

Systems and Networks Security: In this course, students will learn
secure system and network administration techniques. Students will
have hands-on system administration experiences with key Internet
services, will learn about important security issues related to such
services, and will be exposed to techniques and tools to analyse,
defend and secure systems and networks.

## Pre-requisites

1. CCOM 4088 - Introduction to Cybersecurity
2. One of:

	- CCOM 4086 - Computer Architecture
	- CCOM 4017 - Operating Systems
	- CCOM 4205 - Computer Networks
  
## Content

The course will use material developed for
[MIT's Graduate Computer Systems Security class](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/general.html)
under a
[Creative Commons Attribution license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/). The
original course material describes the content as:

> Lectures cover threat models, attacks that compromise security, and
> techniques for achieving security, based on recent research
> papers. Topics include operating system (OS) security, capabilities,
> information flow control, language security, network protocols,
> hardware security, and security in web applications. Assignments
> include labs that involve implementing and compromising a secure web
> server and web application, and a group final project.

## Objectives



## Course Schedule

   Class will meet BLANK and BLANK from XXX to XXX  in NCL XXX. In
   UPR-RP attendance is compulsory.

## Instructional resources

The course will be hosted on the <a
href="http://moodle.ccom.uprrp.edu/">CCOM Moodle</a>. Register and
stay tuned for our polls and forum postings.

The course will use material developed for
[MIT's Graduate Computer Systems Security class](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/general.html)
which has lecture notes, videos, lab assignments and quizzes online,
as well as links to reference material.

## Textbook

No textbook. Use the
[MIT course materials](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/general.html).

## Software

MIT's [Lab 1](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/labs/lab1.html)
provides a
[virtual machine image](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~kolya/vm-6858.zip)
you will use for the lab assignments. I have tested the image on
VirtualBox (OS X and linux) and kvm (on linux). Other students have
had trouble with the `gdb` command on OS X. MIT recommends running in
VMWare player or kvm.

## Evaluation

Students work will be evaluated on a 100% basis with the standard curve.

 -        Participation in course forums (online, classroom), 5% final grade
 -        Homework and quizzes, 25% final grade
 -        Two partial exams, 50% final grade
 -        Project, 20% final grade


## Reasonable accomodations for students

Students with disabilities properly registered with the Office of
Affairs for Persons with Disabilities
<a href="http://estudiantes.uprrp.edu/impedimentos/impedimentos.php">Oficina de Asuntos para la Persona con Impedimento (O.A.P.I.)</a> should notify the professor at the
start of the semester. The professor will make reasonable
accommodations to support the student, in consultation with OAPI.
