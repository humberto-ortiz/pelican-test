## Description

This course will give the students of the computer science program a
research experience in a topic related to Computer Science. Each
student will work independently on a research project under the
supoervision of a researcher. There will be weekly meetings to discuss
the progress made and approaches to advance the completion of the
project. At the end of the semester each student will submit a
technical report; in addition will give an oral presentation or will
prepare a poster of the research done. The course can be taken more
than once with a maximum of 6 credits.

### Contingency plan

In case circumstances beyond our control impede the ability to hold presential
clases, the professor will communicate to the students alternative methods for
completing the work.

### Alternative Teaching Methods

Certification No. 112 (2014-2015) of the Governing Board defines a
classroom course as a course in which 75% or more of the hours of
instruction require the physical presence of the students and the
teacher in the classroom.  This means that 25% of a classroom course
could be offered without requiring the physical presence of the
students and the teacher in the classroom.  If necessary, this course
will be able to complete up to 25% of the contact hours (11.25 hours)
on a non-face-to-face basis by alternative methods such as:
videoconferences, instructional modules, discussion forums and
others. If so, the calendar/agenda will be modified to include the
topics that will be covered by alternative methods.

## Reasonable accommodations for students

The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) complies with all federal and state laws and
regulations regarding discrimination, including the American with Disabilities
Act (ADA) and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Law 51. Students who have a
disability or condition that may impair their ability to complete assignments or
otherwise satisfy course criteria are encouraged to meet with the professor to
identify, discuss and document any feasible instructional modifications or
accommodations. The student should notify the instructor such disability or
condition as soon as such disability or condition is known to the student. The
student may also contact the Dean of Student Affair for information and
auxiliary aid.

Students with disabilities properly registered with the Office of
Affairs for Persons with Disabilities <a
href="http://estudiantes.uprrp.edu/servicios-al-estudiante/oapi/">Oficina
de Asuntos para la Persona con Impedimento (O.A.P.I.)</a> should
notify the professor at the start of the semester. The professor will
make reasonable accommodations to support the student, in consultation
with OAPI.

## Academic integrity

The University of Puerto Rico promotes the highest standards of academic and
scientific integrity. Article 6.2 of the UPR Students General Bylaws (Board of
Trustees Certification 13, 2009-2010) states that academic dishonesty includes,
but is not limited to: fraudulent actions; obtaining grades or academic degrees
by false or fraudulent simulations; copying the whole or part of the academic
work of another person; plagiarizing totally or partially the work of another
person; copying all or part of another person answers to the questions of an
oral or written exam by taking or getting someone else to take the exam on
his/her behalf; as well as enabling and facilitating another person to perform
the aforementioned. Any of these behaviors will be subject to disciplinary
action in accordance with the disciplinary procedure laid down in the UPR
Students General Bylaws.

## Discrimination

The University of Puerto Rico prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual
orientation, and gender identity in any of its forms, including that of sexual
harassment. According to the Institutional Policy Against Sexual Harassment at
the University of Puerto Rico, Certification Num. 130, 2014-2015 from the Board
of Governors, any student subjected to acts constituting sexual harassment, must
turn to the Office of the Student Ombudsperson, the Office of the Dean of
Students, and/or the Coordinator of the Office of Compliance with Title IX for
an orientation and/or a formal complaint.
