## Description

Through lectures, group discussions and other active learning
strategies, this course will introduce the students to statistical and
computing methods for observational studies and clinical trials. The
students will acquire knowledge in basic concepts of Data Analysis,
utilizing Biostatistics and Bioinformatics tools, and applying these
to biomedical/translational cancer and population sciences research.

## Pre-requisites

- Calculus I or equivalent

- Basic course in statistics or biostatistics.

## Objectives

At the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Apply the basic methods of data analysis and the elementary
   concepts of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics in applications
   related to Cancer Research.

2. Use powerful and flexible software (such as R and BioConductor
   software packages) to effectively put into practice data analytic
   techniques in Cancer Research and be able to develop inferences.

3. Develop case studies utilizing cancer data.

## Course schedule

   Class will meet Fridays from 1:00 to 3:30 PM in the Medical
   Sciences Campus, Nursing Professions Building, Room 318.

## Instructional resources

The course will be hosted in
[Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com). You need to sign in
with a @upr.edu account.

### Textbook

See the references and course calendar for course materials.

### Software

We will use the [R statistical software](http://www.r-project.org) and
[bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org). Both are open source, and you
can install them on your own computers.

## Evaluation

## Reasonable accomodations for students (Statement of PR Law 51)

Students with a health condition or situation that, according to the
law, makes them eligible for reasonable accommodation have the right
to submit a written application to the Dean, Associate Dean or
Assistant Dean for Students Affairs of their Faculty, according to the
procedures established in the document **Submission Process for
Reasonable Accommodation of the Medical Sciences Campus**. This document
may be obtained at the Deanship for Students Affairs of the MSC, at
each Faculty, and the MSC web page. The application does not exempt
students from complying with the academic requirements pertaining to
the programs.


## Academic integrity

> The University of Puerto Rico promotes the highest standards of
> academic and scientific integrity. Article 6.2 of the UPR Student
> Bylaws (Certification JS 13 2009–2010) states that “academic
> dishonesty includes but is not limited to: fraudulent actions,
> obtaining grades or academic degrees using false or fraudulent
> simulations, copying totally or partially academic work from another
> person, plagiarizing totally or partially the work of another
> person, copying totally or partially responses from another person
> to examination questions, making another person to take any test,
> oral or written examination on his/hers behalf, as well as assisting
> or facilitating any person to incur in the aforementioned
> conduct”. Fraudulent conduct refers to “behavior with the intent to
> defraud, including but not limited to, malicious alteration or
> falsification of grades, records, identification cards or other
> official documents of the UPR or any other institution.” Any of
> these actions shall be subject to disciplinary sanctions in
> accordance with the disciplinary procedure, as stated in the
> existing UPR Student Bylaws.

DISCLAIMER: The above statement is an English translation, prepared at
the Deanship of Academic Affairs of the Medical Sciences Campus, of
certain parts of Article 6.2 of the UPR Student Bylaws “Reglamento
General de Estudiantes de la Universidad de Puerto Rico”,
(Certificación JS 13 2009-2010). It is in no way intended to be a
legal substitute for the original document, written in Spanish.
