## Content

The course will use material developed for
[MIT's Graduate Computer Systems Security class](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2019/schedule.html)
under a
[Creative Commons Attribution license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/). The
original course material describes the content as:

> Lectures cover threat models, attacks that compromise security, and
> techniques for achieving security, based on recent research
> papers. Topics include operating system (OS) security, capabilities,
> information flow control, language security, network protocols,
> hardware security, and security in web applications. Assignments
> include labs that involve implementing and compromising a secure web
> server and web application, and a group final project.

## Objectives

After successfully completing the course students will be able to:

| Course Objective | Program Outcome |
|--------------|----------------|
| Analyze a computer system, identifying one or more potential security vulnerabilities |Creative and analytic ability, and capacity for logical reasoning |
| Exploit common security vulnerabilities | Ability to identify, organize, evaluate, and use information | 
| Understand mitigation techniques implemented in modern computer systems | Ability to identify and formulate problems in various real-life situations that can be solved by concepts and computational models and to implement them effectively|
| Implement changes to a computer system to mitigate security risks | Ability to identify and formulate problems in various real-life situations that can be solved by concepts and computational models and to implement them effectively |
| Assess the risks in a computer system | Creative and analytic ability, and capacity for logical reasoning |

## Course schedule

   Class will meet Mondays and Wednesdays from 10:00 to 11:20 AM in CN 114A. In
   [UPR-RP](http://www.uprrp.edu/) attendance is compulsory.

### Alternative Teaching Methods

Certification No. 112 (2014-2015) of the Governing Board defines a
classroom course as a course in which 75% or more of the hours of
instruction require the physical presence of the students and the
teacher in the classroom.  This means that 25% of a classroom course
could be offered without requiring the physical presence of the
students and the teacher in the classroom.  If necessary, this course
will be able to complete up to 25% of the contact hours (11.25 hours)
on a non-face-to-face basis by alternative methods such as:
videoconferences, instructional modules, discussion forums and
others. If so, the calendar/agenda will be modified to include the
topics that will be covered by alternative methods.

## Instructional resources

The course will be hosted on the [UPR RP Moodle](http://online.uprrp.edu/). 
Register and stay tuned for our polls and forum postings.

The course will use material developed for
[MIT's Graduate Computer Systems Security class](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2019/general.html)
which has lecture notes, videos, lab assignments and quizzes online,
as well as links to reference material.

## Textbook

We will mostly use the
[MIT course materials](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2019/schedule.html)

We will also use the
book. [Hacking: the Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition](http://www.nostarch.com/hacking2.htm). Jon
Erickson. No Starch Press. 2008. ISBN-13: 978-1-59327-144-2

## Software

MIT's [Lab 1](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2019/labs/lab1.html)
provides a
[virtual machine image](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jfrg/6.858-x86_64-v19.zip)
you will use for the lab assignments. I have tested the image on
VirtualBox (OS X and linux) and kvm (on linux). Other students have
had trouble with the `gdb` command on OS X. MIT recommends running in
VMWare player or kvm.

## Course policies

Be excellent to each other.

## Evaluation

Students work will be evaluated on a 100% basis with the standard curve.

 -        Participation in course forums (online, classroom), 25% final grade
 -        Homework and quizzes, 50% final grade
 -        Project, 25% final grade


## Reasonable accommodations for students

Students with disabilities properly registered with the Office of
Affairs for Persons with Disabilities <a
href="http://estudiantes.uprrp.edu/impedimentos/impedimentos.php">Oficina
de Asuntos para la Persona con Impedimento (O.A.P.I.)</a> should
notify the professor at the start of the semester. The professor will
make reasonable accommodations to support the student, in consultation
with OAPI.

## Academic integrity

> The University of Puerto Rico promotes the highest standards of
> academic and scientific integrity. Article 6.2 of the UPR Student
> Bylaws (Certification JS 13 2009–2010) states that “academic
> dishonesty includes but is not limited to: fraudulent actions,
> obtaining grades or academic degrees using false or fraudulent
> simulations, copying totally or partially academic work from another
> person, plagiarizing totally or partially the work of another
> person, copying totally or partially responses from another person
> to examination questions, making another person to take any test,
> oral or written examination on his/hers behalf, as well as assisting
> or facilitating any person to incur in the aforementioned
> conduct”. Fraudulent conduct refers to “behavior with the intent to
> defraud, including but not limited to, malicious alteration or
> falsification of grades, records, identification cards or other
> official documents of the UPR or any other institution.” Any of
> these actions shall be subject to disciplinary sanctions in
> accordance with the disciplinary procedure, as stated in the
> existing UPR Student Bylaws.

DISCLAIMER: The above statement is an English translation, prepared at
the Deanship of Academic Affairs of the Medical Sciences Campus, of
certain parts of Article 6.2 of the UPR Student Bylaws “Reglamento
General de Estudiantes de la Universidad de Puerto Rico”,
(Certificación JS 13 2009-2010). It is in no way intended to be a
legal substitute for the original document, written in Spanish.
