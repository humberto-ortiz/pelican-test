## Credits

3 credits

## Description

Introductory graduate/undergraduate course in bioinformatics. Topics covered
will include biological sequences, programming in python, UNIX, sequence
alignments, sequence phylogeny, sequence database searches, and gene expresion
analysis, including microarray and RNA-Seq analysis, and gene set or pathway
analysis.

We will emphasize the fundamental theory behind the analysis, and also
present practical problems and their solutions. The course will use
open-source bioinformatics tools such as bioconductor, and show how to
construct such tools using python, R, or other languages.

## Prerequisites

MATE 3026 or MATE 3028 or CCOM 3033

The course is designed for graduate and advanced undergraduate
students in biology or computer science. Students should have some
familiarity with programming.

## Course schedule

The course will meet Thursdays and Fridays from 11:30AM-12:50PM in room
CNL A-143, Natural Sciences, Rio Piedras Campus, University of Puerto
Rico.

## Objectives

Introduce students to fundamental concepts in bioinformatics,
programming, algorithm design and analysis. After completing the course,
students should be able to select tools and programs to solve
bioinformatic problems and participate in their development.

## Academic integrity

>    The University of Puerto Rico promotes the highest standards of
>    academic and scientific integrity. Article 6.2 of the UPR Student
>    Bylaws (Certification JS 13 2009–2010) states that “academic
>    dishonesty includes but is not limited to: fraudulent actions,
>    obtaining grades or academic degrees using false or fraudulent
>    simulations, copying totally or partially academic work from
>    another person, plagiarizing totally or partially the work of
>    another person, copying totally or partially responses from
>    another person to examination questions, making another person to
>    take any test, oral or written examination on his/hers behalf, as
>    well as assisting or facilitating any person to incur in the
>    aforementioned conduct”. Fraudulent conduct refers to “behavior
>    with the intent to defraud, including but not limited to,
>    malicious alteration or falsification of grades, records,
>    identification cards or other official documents of the UPR or
>    any other institution.” Any of these actions shall be subject to
>    disciplinary sanctions in accordance with the disciplinary
>    procedure, as stated in the existing UPR Student Bylaws.

DISCLAIMER: The above statement is an English translation, prepared at
the Deanship of Academic Affairs of the Medical Sciences Campus, of
certain parts of Article 6.2 of the UPR Student Bylaws “Reglamento
General de Estudiantes de la Universidad de Puerto Rico”,

legal substitute for the original document, written in Spanish.

## Policy on sexual discrimination or harassment

The University of Puerto Rico prohibits discrimination based on sex,
sexual orientation, and gender identity in any of its forms, including
that of sexual harassment. According to the Institutional Policy
Against Sexual Harassment at the University of Puerto Rico,
Certification Num. 130, 2014-2015 from the Board of Governors, any
