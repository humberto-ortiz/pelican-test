Academic integrity
==================

   The University of Puerto Rico promotes the highest standards of
   academic and scientific integrity. Article 6.2 of the UPR Student
   Bylaws (Certification JS 13 2009–2010) states that “academic
   dishonesty includes but is not limited to: fraudulent actions,
   obtaining grades or academic degrees using false or fraudulent
   simulations, copying totally or partially academic work from
   another person, plagiarizing totally or partially the work of
   another person, copying totally or partially responses from another
   person to examination questions, making another person to take any
   test, oral or written examination on his/hers behalf, as well as
   assisting or facilitating any person to incur in the aforementioned
   conduct”. Fraudulent conduct refers to “behavior with the intent to
   defraud, including but not limited to, malicious alteration or
   falsification of grades, records, identification cards or other
   official documents of the UPR or any other institution.” Any of
   these actions shall be subject to disciplinary sanctions in
   accordance with the disciplinary procedure, as stated in the
   existing UPR Student Bylaws.

DISCLAIMER: The above statement is an English translation, prepared at
the Deanship of Academic Affairs of the Medical Sciences Campus, of
certain parts of Article 6.2 of the UPR Student Bylaws “Reglamento
General de Estudiantes de la Universidad de Puerto Rico”,
(Certificación JS 13 2009-2010). It is in no way intended to be a
legal substitute for the original document, written in Spanish.
