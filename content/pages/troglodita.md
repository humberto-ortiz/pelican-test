I think the World Wide Web is a tool for publishing information. I
used to think most presentation technology (flash, java, javascript, even CSS)
detracts from that. This is the 21st century, so I've been dragged
kicking and screaming into using CSS.

These pages use standard HTML or XHTML markup, with no gizmos. The
pages are "troglodita approved", and should render in anything. In
fact, to qualify as "troglodita approved" you have to validate as
Strict HTML or XHTML.

Yotuel Gonzalez of the [HPCf](http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/) did the seal,
I think he did a great job.
