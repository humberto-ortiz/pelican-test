I got eclipse glasses from the
[EcoExploratorio](https://ecoexploratorio.org/) and we saw part of the
eclipse on Saturday, October 14, 2023.

Around 2:00 PM AST (18:00 UTC) it got cloudy, and we lost our chance
to see the maximum extent, which happened around 2:24 PM. Fortunately,
we have access to a camera that had an unobstructed view: the
[GOES-16](https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/geostationary-operational-environmental-satellite-16)
satellite in geosynchronous orbit. Colorado State Universitiy's
[SLIDER app](https://rammb-slider.cira.colostate.edu/) lets you export
a satellite loop as a gif or png. I've embedded an animated gif below.
