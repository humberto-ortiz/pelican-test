After Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017 I bought a
[solar panel kit](https://www.renogy.com/renogy-100w-12v/starter-kit/). The
kit had a 100 Watt solar panel (12 V), a charge controller, and
cabling.  I had already purchased a 1200 Watt inverter after Hurricane
Irma, and pulled the battery from one of the cars. Later I replaced
the battery with a 80 ampere hour deep-cycle sealed battery I sourced locally.

I set up the system like the
[50 Watt kit](https://medium.com/@themis.ariana/monta-tu-propio-kit-de-energ%C3%ADa-solar-16397e7c71fd)
the
[Maria Tech Brigade](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3kaejw/hurricane-maria-tech-brigade-connecting-puerto-rico-diaspora)
published. I can run the inverter for A/C, or use car chargers hooked
straight to the 12V D/C battery.

The 100 Watt panel can keep a couple cellphones and computers charged
all day, or run a couple of fans for a few hours. We're still getting
11 hours of daylight (we're only 18 degrees north of the equator), so
one 100 Watt panel should be producing 50 or so ampere-hours. The kit
I bought is expandable to 400 Watts (4 panels), so I plan to slowly
grow the system.

I guess one good thing about Hurricane Maria is lots of people are
looking and moving to solar power. The Maria Tech Brigade and others
are helping demystify the technology, and prices keep getting lower.
