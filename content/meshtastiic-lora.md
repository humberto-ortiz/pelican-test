I bought a pair of [Lilygo T-Echo
radios](https://lilygo.cc/products/t-echo-meshtastic) with
[meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) firmware two years ago for my
birthday, but I had limited success connecting to anyone.

Suddenly, a couple of weeks ago I started seeing radio traffic from
Carolina to Caguas. It looks like someone close to my house set up a
repeater, and traffic was reaching me. If I take a radio to the third
floor of my office building, I can send a message home (just over 5 km
or 3 mi) with high probability.

Reception at my house has always been a problem, before cable TV, we
had a TV antenna on a giant pole so we could pick up broadcast TV. The
meshtastic LoRa coverage is wierd, because I can only see traffic
basically in a narrow strip running from Caguas to Carolina, but I've
spoken to people on airplanes.

Meshtastic (and LoRa) send text messages over LoRa, I've paired a
phone or tether a computer to the T-Echo units to use with the
meshtastic app on Android or linux.
