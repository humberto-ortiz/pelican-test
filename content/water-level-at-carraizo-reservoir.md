We're in the middle of an extended draught, and water has been
rationed for almost a month in most of the metropolitan area.

I made an [openshift](http://openshift.com/) app using
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [pygal](http://pygal.org/)
to scrape the data from
[the water authority's page](http://www.acueductospr.com/niveles/) and
[plot it](http://flask-alephazul.rhcloud.com/).

The [source code](https://github.com/humberto-ortiz/niveles-carraizo)
for everything is available.
