## MATH 6685 - Computer applications in biology

Introductory graduate course in bioinformatics to be offered Spring
2017 in UPR-RP. Topics covered will include biological sequences,
programming in python, UNIX, sequence alignments, sequence phylogeny,
sequence database searches, and gene expresion analysis, including
microarray and RNA-Seq analysis, and gene set or pathway analysis.

We will emphasize the fundamental theory behind the analysis, and also
present practical problems and their solutions. The course will use
open-source bioinformatics tools such as bioconductor, and show how to
construct such tools using python.

## Prerequisites

MATE 3026 or MATE 3028 or CCOM 3033

The course is designed for graduate and advanced undergraduate
students in biology or computer science. Students should have some
familiarity with programming.
