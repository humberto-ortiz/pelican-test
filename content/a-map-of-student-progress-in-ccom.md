# Introduction

We were discussing in our department the pre-requisites for different
courses in computer science, and I started wondering about the "normal
progression" of students in our Computer Science bachellor's
degree. We have a suggested 4 year curriculum, but hardly any students
graduate in 4 years. I wanted to see if some visualizations could show
any bottlenecks or problem areas in our program.

# Methods

I obtained a database of course attempts by all computer science
students, and the list of suggested courses by semester for students
arriving with pre-calculus and those arriving without pre-calculus.

I prepared a jupyter notebook with the analysis and plots.

# Results

See the notebook embedded below.

# Discussion

I was surprised by the failure rate in introductory CS courses by
students *with* pre-calculus.

I was surprised data structures isn't a bottleneck.

The advanced algebra courses are a significant source of delay in
graduation.
