I've been a bit under the weather for a couple of months. I had a bout
of [chikunguya fever](http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/), and a
lingering pain in my right shoulder. It turns out the
[shoulder was frozen](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000455.htm). I've
had a week of physical therapy at Tort Therapeutic Elements, and am
starting to feel better.

Yesterday I put the shoulder to the test and went out for a short
[skate row on paseo lineal](http://www.mapmyrun.com/workout/868934513). I
put in almost 5 miles, on a beautiful Sunday morning. Paseo lineal was
full, the parking lot was completely full and the paths were crowded.
