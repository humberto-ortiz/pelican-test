Saturday afternoon I had a
[nice ride on my longboard](http://www.mapmyrun.com/workout/2174469050)
out on the Paseo Puerta de Tierra. I started out in Condado, by the
lagoon, and followed the bike path up to Escambr칩n. The weather was
great, and there wasn't a lot of traffic on the path. Once past
Escambr칩n, I hit the newly remodeled part up past El Hamburger to El
Capitolio. Brand new cement tiles and a set of broad criss-crossing
paths on the bluffs overlooking the Atlantic. I turned around at Plaza
Col칩n, the part between the capitol and the plaza is a bit sketchy. I
came back on the bike path on the south side of the capitol and the
Parque Luis Mo침oz Rivera.
