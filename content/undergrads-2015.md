I'm very proud of my undergraduate students this semester. They put in
a lot of effort, and it shows. Go see our
[lab page](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/megaprobe/) and look for
their presentations and technical reports.

There are five technical reports on
[network flows](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/megaprobe/tag/flows.html),
[graph algorithms](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/megaprobe/tag/graphs.html),
[cybersecurity](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/megaprobe/tag/cybersecurity.html)
and
[sequence assembly](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/megaprobe/tag/sequence-assembly.html),
and about as many presentations or posters.

I hope *some* of them come back next year!
