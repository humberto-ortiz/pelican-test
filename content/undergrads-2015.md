I'm very proud of my undergraduate students this semester. They put in
a lot of effort, and it shows. Go see our
[lab page](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/megaprobe/) and look for
their presentations and technical reports.

There are five technical reports on network flows, graph algoritms,
cybersecurity and sequence assembly, and about as many presentations
or posters.

I hope *some* of them come back next year!
