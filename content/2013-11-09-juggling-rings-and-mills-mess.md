Cassandra went to <a href="http://odge.mit.edu/undergraduate/converge/">MIT CONVERGE</a> for the weekend and left me her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Duncan-3860JG-Juggling-Rings/dp/B0008G5IXU">Duncan Juggling Rings</a>. I got a little practice in with them yesterday and today. They're not fancy, but they work. I hope I can practice enough I can take a stab at dinner plates! I also juggled a bit with clubs, just a straight up cascade, and kept working on my 3-ball tricks. I can do 3-ball cascade, reverse cascade (not pretty), and half-showers (left to right, ok; right to left, not so ok). I'm working on getting Mill's Mess done, using a couple of <a href="http://youtu.be/GiMHQ7nOa0k">youtube videos</a>. I still need to practice a lot.
